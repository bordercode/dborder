### Diabetes y la epidemida de padecimientos crónicos degenerativos. Además un padecimiento considerado como de alto impacto financiero para el sector salud Mexicano en el corto plazo.

The evolution of type II diabetes as a death cause in Mexico increased by 76% during
the period between 1998-2013, while the over all death causes experienced a 18,3%
increase in same period. The exponential growth rate implicit by this trend reflects a
public health concern of epidemic proportions.
Although diabetes is a major public health problem in Mexico previously thought to be
related to population with relative higher income levels or affluent, recent studies had
suggested an epidemiological transition impacting individuals in lower income regions.
Studies conducted with a focus on the Mexican population suggest that this transition
may be linked to nutritional changes (Seuring, Goryakin & Suhrcke, 2015). Argument
that highlights the importance to consider social determinants of health such as
consumption patterns as contextual factors to understand this growing public health
treat.
Studies emphasizing behavioral determinants have established that inadequate diet is
a key risk factor for the development of T2D (Sundquist, Eriksson, Mezuk & Ohlsson,
2015; Wali, Thomas & Sutherland, 2014). According to Ortiz-Hernández (2006), a link
towards diabetes development through consumption practices finds a key path via the
metabolic energy intake balance; the path identified can be traced back to life style
habits further pressured by low price per calories processed foods available at the
neighborhood scale.
As evidence suggest, diet follow trends tied to consumption practices that differ across
demographic groups and regions (Gordon-Larsen, Guilkey and Popkin, 2011). Although
it is recognized that T2D is a multifactorial public health issue and its determinants are
not limited to consumption patterns, considering contextual factors may provide
additional insights to improve its understanding at a regional scale.
Despite the importance of geographic location to explain this epidemic, in the past
decades the study of biological risk factors has been the dominant paradigm (Graves
and Kayal, 2008; Stolar 2010). While research on environmental correlates of physical
activity such as obesity, a well-known risk factor for the development of diabetes (Day
and Baily, 2011) has been well documented in the US Mexico border communities
(Fisher-Hoch et al., 2010). There is a clear research gap relative to diabetes studies for
the Mexican southern border states and its connections to population consumption
patterns at a local level.
